in 2016, I was doing a short-term program at the Central European University, then located in Budapest, Hungary. I took a multivariate statistics class in which our final project required us to work collaboratively using a technique learned to class to analyze some open data set. At that time, I was using the 2009 results of The World Bank's survey on Access to Financial Services in Indonesia. This dataset is no longer openly available - I think because the methodology changed - so I haven't included it in this repo. But you can find the following: 

(1) R code from the final project

(2) Word document of our final report

(3) The survey questions used then
